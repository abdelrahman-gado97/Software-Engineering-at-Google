* The critical idea in this chapter is that software development is a team endeavor. And
to succeed on an engineering team—or in any other creative collaboration—you need
to reorganize your behaviors around the core principles of humility, respect, and
trust.

## Help me hide my code
* People are afraid of others seeing and judging their work in progress.

## The Genius Myth
* The Genius Myth is the tendency that we as humans need to ascribe the success of a team to a single person/leader.
* We all need heroes for inspiration, and the programming world has its heroes, We all want to write something world-changing like Linux or design the next brilliant programming language.
* Geniuses still make mistakes, and having brilliant ideas and elite programming skills doesn’t guarantee that your software will be a hit. Worse, you might find yourself solving only analytical problems and not **human problems**.
* What will make or break your career, especially at a company like Google, is how well you collaborate with others.
* Many programmers are afraid to share work they’ve only just started because it means peers will see their mistakes and know the author of the code is not a genius.
* Another common motivation for hiding your work is the fear that another programmer might take your idea and run with it before you get around to working on it


## Hiding considered harmful

* If you spend all of your time working alone, you’re increasing the risk of unnecessary
   failure.Even though software development is deeply intellectual work that can require deep concentration and alone time, you must play that off against the value (and need!) for collaboration and review.

### Early Detection
* If you keep your great idea hidden from the world, It’s easy to make fundamental design mistakes early on. You risk reinventing wheels.The more feedback you take early on, the more you lower this risk. you need to make sure that you’re working on the right thing, you’re doing it correctly.

### The Bus Factor
* Bus factor is the number of people that need to get hit by a bus before your
   project is completely doomed.
* If you’re the only person who understands how the prototype code works, you might enjoy good job security—but if you get hit by a bus, the project is toast. 
* Ensuring that there is at least good documentation in addition to a primary and a secondary owner for each area of responsibility helps future-proof your project’s success and increases your project’s bus factor.
* Working with other people directly increases the collective wisdom behind the effort. This is exactly why teams sit together (or do pair programming) in software engineering companies.

### Pace of Progress
* Programmers work best in tight feedback loops: write a new function, compile. Add a test, compile. Refactor some code, compile. This way, we discover and fix typos and bugs as soon as possible after generating code.
* This is all bundled into the idea of “shifting left” in the developer workflow; the earlier we find a problem, the cheaper it is to fix it.
* The same sort of rapid feedback loop is needed not just at the code level, but at the
   whole-project level.
* by working in a team, we get the feedback loop so that we know the instant plan and designs.
* “Many eyes make sure your project stays relevant and on track.” People working in caves awaken to discover that while their original vision might be complete, the world has changed and their project has become irrelevant.

**In Short, Don't Hide** -> working alone is inherently riskier than working with others

## It's All About the Team

- **software engineering is a team endeavor.**
- You need to work with other people. Share your vision. Divide the labor. Learn from others. Create a brilliant team.
- High-functioning teams are gold and the true key to success. You should be aiming for this experience however you can.
   
### The three pillars of social interaction

* If teamwork is the best route to producing great software, how does one build a great team? 
* To reach to the effective collabration. you need to learn about the "three pillars of social interaction"
	1. Humility -> You are not the center of the universe (nor is your code!). You’re open to self-improvement.
	2. Respect -> You genuinely care about others you work with. You treat them kindly and
	 appreciate their abilities and accomplishments.
	3. Trust -> You believe others are competent and will do the right thing, and you’re OK with letting them drive when appropriate.
* If you perform a root-cause analysis on almost any social conflict, you can ultimately
   trace it back to a lack of humility, respect, and/or trust.

### Why does these pillars matters?
* Do not underestimate the power of playing the social game. It’s not about tricking or manipulating people; it’s about creating relationships to get things done. Relationships always outlast projects.

### Humility, Respect, and Trust in Practice

#### Lose the ego

* Nobody wants to work with someone who consistently behaves like they’re the most important person in the room.
* think about going for a “collective” ego, instead; rather than worrying aboutTake extra care to make sure the postmortem document isn’t just a
useless list of apologies or excuses or finger-pointing—that’s not its purpose. whether you’re personally awesome, try to build a sense of team accomplishment and group pride.

#### Learn to give and take criticism

* In a professional software engineering environment, criticism is almost never personal—it’s usually just part of the process of making a better project. The trick is to make sure you (and those around you) understand the difference between a constructive criticism of someone’s creative output and a flat-out assault against someone’s character.
* On the other side of the conversation, you need to learn to accept criticism as well.
* "you are not your code".

#### Fail fast and iterate
* “Failure is an option.”
* Failure is viewed as a golden opportunity to learn and improve for the next go-around.

#### Blameless Post-Mortem Culture
* The key to learning from your mistakes is to document your failures by performing a root cause analysis and writing up a “postmortem,” as it’s called at Google.
* Take extra care to make sure the postmortem document isn’t just a useless list of apologies or excuses or finger-pointing—that’s not its purpose.
* A proper postmortem should always contain an explanation of what was learned and what is going to change as a result of the learning experience. 

* A good postmortem should include the following:
	1. A brief summary of the event
	2. A timeline of the event
	3. The primary cause of the event
	4. Impact and damage assessment
	5. A set of action items (with owners) to fix the problem immediately
	6. A set of action items to prevent the event from happening again
	7. Lessons learned

##### Learn Patience
##### Be open to influence
* Admitting that you’ve made a mistake or you’re simply out of your league can increase your status over the long run. In fact, the willingness to express vulnerability is an outward show of humility, it demonstrates accountability and the willingness to take responsibility, and it’s a signal that you trust others’ opinions.

#### Being Googley
*  What we mean by "Googleyness":
	1. Thrives in ambiguity -> Can deal with conflicting messages or directions,and make progress against a problem, even when the environment is constantly shifting.

	2. Values feedback -> Has humility to both receive and give feedback gracefully and understands how valuable feedback is for personal (and team) development. 

	3. Challenges status quo -> Is able to set ambitious goals and pursue them even when there might be resistance or inertia from others.

	4. Puts the user first -> Has empathy and respect for users of Google’s products and pursues actions that are in their best interests.

	5. Cares about the team -> Has empathy and respect for coworkers and actively works to help them without being asked, improving team cohesion.

	6. Does the right thing -> Has a strong sense of ethics about everything they do; willing to make difficult or inconvenient decisions to protect the integrity of the team and product.
